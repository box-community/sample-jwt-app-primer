# Box + JWT Primer

This document describes a method for provisioning Box applications using OAuth2 with JWT. It is aimed at developers wishing to build server-based applications or scripts that target personal- or group-owned enterprise content. 

## JWT App Examples

* [.Net (C#)](examples/csharp-netcore)
* [.Net (F#)](examples/fsharp-netcore)
* [Python](examples/python)
* [Node.js](examples/node)

Each of these examples does three things:

1. *Authenticate a Box [SDK](https://developer.box.com/docs/sdks) client as the Box JWT service account.*
2. *Print the JWT service account name and login.* The login is necessary to invite the JWT app as a collaborator on enterprise content.
3. *Walk a Box folder tree and print its contents.* Box folder traversal is a common activity in Box applications and it can maybe be a bit challenging for folks that haven't worked with recursion in a while. I included the pattern here as a little quick-starter.

For each of these examples you will need a configured JWT app and the JSON config file with your JWT app credentials. Your app will also need to be approved in at least one enterprise (a development enterprise works fine here.) Read on to learn more about what all that means!

## A (Very) Short Introduction to OAuth2 and the Problem it Solves

Imagine you are a Box user and you have an application that wants to access your Box files. You'd like to grant this access and you have no reason to mistrust the app, but nevertheless you are a good security-minded Box user and you have some concerns:

1. Authentication: Will I have to share my Box/SSO credentials with the app?
2. Authorization: How do I know what the app can do with my files?
3. Revocation: How am I be assured that I can turn that sharing off in the future?

[OAuth2](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-oauth-2) is an industry-standard authorization framework designed to address these concerns. Specifically:

1. Your credentials are never shared with the app. Instead, Box gives the app a unique, time-limited token with which the app can make Box API calls on your behalf.
2. The app developer must specify up front what permissions ("scopes") it needs on your files. Prior to authorizing access you can review and confirm the requested permissions. Box enforces those permissions at the API level.
3. At any time, you can tell both the app and/or Box to stop sharing your data. Future API calls from the app will be rejected as unauthorized.

## The Two Flavors of OAuth2 in Box

*"3-legged" OAuth2* was designed for mobile/browser application development. It enables users to securely share their content (such as Box files) with a 3rd party application and revoke that permission at any time. For many years this was the only authentication method provided by Box.

3-legged OAuth has some design features that make it great for mobile/browser apps but difficult to use with enterprise/administrative scripts and applications. The browser-based authentication model requires human interaction and is difficult to script. It requires the application to maintain and update certain pieces of authorization state over time, the loss of which can disable the application. It does not play nicely in environments with concurrent/HA processes.

*OAuth2 with JSON Web Token (JWT)* was designed for server-to-server interaction (batch jobs, adminstrative tasks, etc.) It differs from 3-legged OAuth in some key ways that make it more suitable for server-based applications:

+ **JWT auth does not require human interaction beyond the initial setup and configuration.** During the configuration process a developer will select the permissions the application will need to do to perform its tasks (e.g. 'Manage Enterprise Users' or 'Manage Groups'). An Enterprise co-admin pre-authorizes the application with those specific permissions. The JWT authorization process is then fully programmatic and no browser interaction is required.

+ **JWT auth is designed for multi-process/multi-node/HA environments.** Multiple API access tokens can be in use at any given time across multiple processes/nodes. When a process needs an API access token, it simply requests one from Box using a request signed by the applications' private key.

+ **JWT access tokens are stateless.** When an access token expires it is not refreshed; you simply request a new one. Eliminating refresh tokens reduces the amount of state that must be maintained and managed by the application, and removes the risk and frustration of disabling the application following a failure to properly maintain refresh tokens.

## Box Service Accounts vs Box Enterprise Accounts

Applications using 3-legged OAuth are typically intended to interact with an individual Enterprise user's account. That authorization process results in an access token that is tied to some existing Box account.

Server-based JWT-based applications *may* access user data, but they may have other intended uses: updating Box group definitions, syncing user accounts, etc. Therefore, a JWT applicaton is associated with a Service Account that is created automatically when you setup the JWT app.

The Service Account is a full-fledged Box account, however it is not directly tied to your Box Enterprise, nor can it be viewed or managed through your standard Enterprise administration tools. Nevertheless, Service Accounts are an ideal model for fine-grained access control:

+ By default, a JWT application has no access to your existing Enterprise content. Access to content can be selectively granted and managed through collaborations. 
+ Unlike 3-legged OAuth, a JWT app's permissions are not related to an existing Enterprise user. The JWT app will be granted the exact permissions that you select when configuring the app.

# Creating a Box JWT Application

Refer to the Box documentation on [Authentication with JWT](https://developer.box.com/docs/authentication-with-jwt) for detailed information on working with JWT applications. Note that the Box documentation refers to certain Box Platform features such as 'App Auth' and 'App Users' which also use JWT but are not intended to work with existing Enterprise content.

## Configure a New JWT Application

1. Browse to https://developers.box.com/ and Log In.
2. Choose **Create New App** in the upper-right corner.
3. On the _Let's Get Started_ page, choose **Enterprise Integration**. Click **Next**.
4. On the _Authentication Method_ page, chose **OAuth 2.0 with JWT (Server Authentication)**. Click **Next**.
5. On the _What would you like to name your app?_ page, select a meaningful name for your application. Note that this will be the name visible to users on any collaboration folders to which this app has access. Click **Create App**.
6. Click **View Your App**

7. Configure the applications permissions under _Application Access_, _Application Scopes_, and _Advanced Features_. The following diagram represents the most restrictive (safest) permission set. If your use case is limited to working with files or folders owned by you or a department, set the _Application Access_ to _Enterprise_, deselect all _Application Scope_, and disable all _Advanced Features_. 

![Configuration1.PNG](img/Configuration1.PNG)  

8. Under _Add and Manage Public Keys_ choose **Generate a Public/Private Keypair**. A JSON file will be downloaded by your browser. *This file contains all the credentials needed to authenticate your JWT application, so keep it stored securely and do not commit it to version control!*  

9. Click **Save Changes** to finalize your configuration.

You can come back and update this configuration at any time, however if you modify the application permissions it must be reauthorized by an enterprise co-admin.

## Authorize your JWT Application

JWT apps differ from 3-legged apps in that they are pre-authorized by your Enterprise Co-Admin for use with their requested permissions. The Co-Admin can revoke authorization at any time, and reauthorization is required if the permission set is ever changed. The steps for this authorization are layed out below.

#### For Developers

From your JWT app Configuration screen, scroll to the _OAuth 2.0 Credentials_. Send the _Client ID_ to your Box Enterprise Co-Admin. The Client _ID_ is not a secret and can safely be sent in email or chat.

#### For Co-Admins

1. Browse to your Admin Console, select the **Gear** symbol in the upper-right of the screen, and select **Elite Settings**
![AdminConsole1.PNG](img/AdminConsole1.PNG)
2. Select the **Apps** tab. Under _Custom Applications_ choose **Authorize New App**.
![AdminConsole2.PNG](img/AdminConsole2.PNG)
3. In the _API Key_ field, paste in the _Client ID_ that was sent to you by the Developer. Click **Next**.
4. Review the requested permissions. Contact the Developer if you wish to inquire as to why a specific permission is required. Click **Authorize** to finalize the approval process.

5. The JWT app is now authorized for use and will apear under the list of _Custom Applications_.

## Accessing Departmental/Group Content with your JWT App

At this point your JWT app has been authorized. With the JSON config file you can run any of the [JWT App examples](#jwt-app-examples) in this repository.

By default the JWT app cannot access any data in your enterprise. To work with files in user or departmental Box folder, the JWT app service account must be invited to collaborate on that folder. You can limit the app's permissions on your folder by choosing the appropriate [collaboration role](https://community.box.com/t5/Collaborate-By-Inviting-Others/Understanding-Collaborator-Permission-Levels/ta-p/144). When you run one of the app examples above, it will print out the service account login.

The Service Account can be invited to a collaboration like any other Box user. Simply copy and paste the service account login from the previous step into the invitee field and give the Service Account the appropriate level of access to the folder content.

![Collaboration1.PNG](img/Collaboration1.PNG)

The collaboration will be automatically accepted and the Service Account will appear as an external collaborator. Your JWT app can now work with data in that collaboration folder.

# Frequently Asked Questions

**I heard that JWT apps should only be used for true enterprise things like user administration.**

JWT is generally appropriate for any non-person/server workflow. What makes a JWT app an 'enterprise' app is the selection of management scopes (i.e. Manage Users, Manage Groups) that give it certain elevated privileges once its authorized in your enterprise. If the scopes are minimally selected as outlined above, then in fact a JWT app has *fewer* permissions in your enterprise than a default 3-legged OAuth app.

**When I go to authorize the JWT app it says that I see something that says "0 of 25 App Users licenses used". Does that mean I can only have 25 JWT apps in my enterprise?**

No. The App User model is part of the "white label" Box offering (confusingly) named "Box Platform." If you limit your JWT app activity to enterprise management and/or collaboration on enterprise data, you will never create "App Users", and as a result will never hit that App User limit.

**We have been successfully using 3-legged OAuth2 for server apps for a long time. Our token management process works fine for us.**

So have I! For a long time it was the only option. If you like it, keep doing it. However, JWT will probably be easier for new enterprise and departmental developers to work with, especially if they're coming from other platforms (Google, etc) where JWT is the norm for server-based applications.

**I don't see an example app in Java/Go/Rust/Haskell/PHP/Erlang/Ruby/Elixir/VB/Perl...**

Let's work together to create one, or feel free to code one up yourself and we can add it here. I only ask that you stick to the general format of the existing example apps.

**I have other questions that were missed here.**
